# ResearchFoci

Research foci (and current projects/sub-repos):

1) Understand how the human brain produces precise and coordinated speech movements; 
- Temporal regularities in inter-articulator speech motor coordination
- Spatiotemporal patterns of jaw open-close movements during speech.
- Reliability of articulography measures of inter-articulator speech motor coordination.

2) Understand how humans learn to produce coordinated speech movements early in development; 
- The development of inter-articulator speech motor coordination in children with hearing loss

3) Understand the contribution of auditory and somatosensory inputs to the coordination and control of speech movements.
- Auditory input regulates vocal tract constriction dynamics during speech production.
- The role of oral somatosensory afferent inputs in inter-articulator speech motor coordination
- Differential use of auditory feedback in the control of speech movements by profoundly deaf talkers with cochlear implants and peers with normal hearing.
